    <h1>Analyzing Honeypot Attacks through Mapping with Azure Sentinel</h1>

    <p>The purpose of analyzing honeypot attacks is to gain insights into the tactics,
        techniques, and motives of malicious actors. By studying and understanding
        these attacks, security professionals can enhance their knowledge of emerging
        threats, identify vulnerabilities in systems and networks, develop more robust
        defense mechanisms, and ultimately improve overall cybersecurity measures.</p>

    <p>Analyzing honeypot attacks helps in detecting patterns, identifying trends, and
        mitigating potential risks in order to enhance the security posture of an
        organization or system.</p>

    <h2>Step 1 â€“ Create a Microsoft Azure Subscription</h2>

    <p>To register for a free Microsoft Azure account, begin by visiting the Azure
        website and selecting the "Start free" or "Get started for free" option. From
        there, either sign in using an existing Microsoft account or create a new one.
        Provide the necessary information, including email, password, and personal
        details. Verify your identity by following the prompted steps. You'll also need to
        provide a payment method, although you won't be billed unless you exceed the
        free account limits or upgrade to a paid subscription. Agree to the terms and
        conditions, and upon completion, you'll have access to your free Azure account
        with limited resources and services. Remember to review the terms to
        understand the constraints and duration of the free offerings.</p>
